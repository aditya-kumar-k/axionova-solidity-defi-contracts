## AXNV-PS-003

**Contract**

AXNVPresaleVesting.sol

**Severity**

Low

**Category**

Accepted Risk

**Description**

Slither reports timestamp-dependent logic.

The contract intentionally relies on `block.timestamp` for:

- Sale status
- TGE activation
- Vesting calculations

This behaviour is expected for a time-based vesting contract.

**Resolution**

Accepted.

No change required.

**Contract**

AXNVPresaleVesting.sol

**Severity**

Informational

**Category**

Optimization

**Description**

Slither reports `_advancePhase()` contains a state update inside a bounded loop.

The presale consists of only three phases, making the loop bounded and predictable.

**Resolution**

No change required.
