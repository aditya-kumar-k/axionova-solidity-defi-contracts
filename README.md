- `AXNVTeamAdvisorFounderVestingVault`
- `AXNVTreasury`
- `AXNVStaking`
- `AXNVLiquidityAllocationVault`
- `AXNVTimelock`
- `AXNVGovernor`
- `AXNVGovernanceVault`
- `AXNVCommunityIncentivesDistributor`
- `AxionovaGamingRewards`
- `AxionovaAIRewards`

## Security Design

AXNV follows a minimal and modular architecture:

- Fixed supply minted once
- No minting after deployment
- No transfer tax
- No blacklist
- No upgradeable proxy for the token
- No bridge logic inside the token
- No presale, airdrop, vesting, staking, liquidity, treasury, governance, or community incentives logic inside the token
- Governance compatibility through ERC20Votes
- Presale purchases recorded in a separate vesting contract
- Presale tokens claimable only after TGE and vesting unlocks
- Airdrop claims verified using Merkle proofs
- Airdrop tokens claimable only after TGE and vesting unlocks
- Team, advisor, and founder allocations managed through a dedicated vesting vault
